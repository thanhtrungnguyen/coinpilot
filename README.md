## System Design

To ensure a highly scalable and maintainable application, the system is divided into three main components:

### 1. AI Training Module
- **Purpose**: Responsible for training and retraining AI models to improve trading predictions.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data collection and preprocessing from multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.
  - Model training and validation using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  - Scheduled retraining using historical data.
  - Exporting models for integration with the backend.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use distributed computing for large datasets (e.g., Apache Spark, Dask).
  - Implement version control for machine learning models (e.g., MLflow, DVC).
  - Store training data and models in a scalable storage solution (e.g., AWS S3).

### 2. Django REST API Backend
- **Purpose**: Acts as the core of the system, providing APIs for the frontend and integrating the AI models.
- **Key Features**:
  - Exposes endpoints for trade execution, market data retrieval, and user portfolio management.
  - Handles business logic, including applying AI predictions to trading strategies.
  - Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use Django REST Framework (DRF) for building APIs.
  - Implement throttling, caching, and pagination for performance optimization.
  - Secure sensitive data with environment variables and libraries like `django-environ`.
  - Use Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ for asynchronous tasks like trade execution.

### 3. NX ReactJS Frontend
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing trading activities.
- **Key Features**:
  - Dashboard for viewing market trends, portfolio performance, and trade history.
  - Configuration interface for setting trading strategies and preferences.
  - Real-time notifications for executed trades and market alerts.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use Nx for modular and scalable frontend architecture.
  - Implement state management with Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
  - Optimize for performance with lazy loading and code splitting.
  - Ensure responsiveness and accessibility (ARIA standards).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js and NX CLI for frontend development
- Docker (optional, for deployment)
- API keys from cryptocurrency exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase)

### Steps

#### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thanhtrungnguyen/coinpilotai.git
   cd coinpilotai/backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure the environment variables (e.g., API keys):
   - Create a `.env` file:
     ```
     API_KEY=your_api_key
     API_SECRET=your_api_secret
     ```
5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd coinpilotai/frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Serve the application in development mode:
   ```bash
   nx serve
   ```

#### AI Training Module Setup
1. Navigate to the AI module directory:
   ```bash
   cd coinpilotai/ai_training
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
